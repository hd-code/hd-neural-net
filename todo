Before release:
[x] unit test integration
    [x] init, train, calc -> x2              – 1,1 net
    [x] init, train, calc -> AND OR XOR XNOR – 2,8,4 net
    [x] init, train, calc -> ackermann       – 2,8,1 net
[ ] unit test isValid
    [ ] invalid net
    [ ] in- and outputs don't match
    [ ] wrong number of inputs
    [ ] wrong number of outputs
    [ ] valid net, input and output
[ ] JSDoc on all public functions
[ ] README file

General:
[ ] better testing framework?
[ ] output types.d.ts as only declaration file

New Features:
- cli with saving neural net as json file to disk
- convolutional layers
- pooling layers
